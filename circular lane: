circular lane:
5 obs 11.8 Msec
Specification of the system:
no of cores used
which equipment is bottlenecking
agent stoppping
range of velocities
both lane same dirn
scenario with incomiong traffic
at best 2 lane roads
for overtake we need to enter into incoming traffic

is unicycle sufficient for tank?
specification is differential drive
delay in controls
model the controller for handling delay
obstacles are moving predictably
offroads
limit in the number of lanes changed

speed of agent
radius of curvature and other curvature constraints
braking distance of obstacles(safety constraint)
velocity should be such that their is no collision on braking
other safety constraints
RSS constraints
Use of ROS2
adavance simulation on the buffertime time for polting
implementing a contorlller(local planner)
integrate with perceptual stack
